# GRPoseNet：Generalizable and Robust 6D Pose Estimation with Sparse Views from RGB Images
（1）**We address the challenging setting of 6D pose estimation for unseen objects using only sparse views from RGB images.**

（2） **We propose an open-world detector** that leverages large models and a matching design based on semantic and geometric information to achieve zero-shot segmentation and matching tasks. **The view selector and refiner** fully utilizes similar view information through multi-scale information and adaptive weights to alleviate the sparse view problem.

（3）**We construct a novel synthetic dataset named RBMOP**, which can be used to evaluate the robustness of the pose estimation model to background and environmental changes.

（4） **Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high performance across various datasets.** Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of key components of the proposed network.
